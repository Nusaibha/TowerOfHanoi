Description: Tower of Hanoi is a classic algorithmic puzzle implemented here in C++ using three vectors to represent the towers. The goal of the game is to move all rings from the starting tower to the destination tower, following three rules: only one ring may be moved at a time, each move involves taking the top ring from one tower and placing it on another, and no larger ring may be placed on top of a smaller one. This implementation takes a user-defined number of rings and automatically solves the puzzle iteratively, printing each move in sequence with clear labeling of the source and destination towers. The program uses a smart ring-tracking logic based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of rings to determine the next valid move, avoiding the need for recursion. It keeps track of moves, ensures valid placement according to the game rules, and continues until all rings are successfully transferred to the middle tower. This project serves as a practical demonstration of algorithmic logic, modular arithmetic, and state simulation using C++ data structures like vectors. Itâ€™s great for learners exploring algorithm design and the Tower of Hanoi problem beyond its recursive form.
